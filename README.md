Instructor: Monireh Razavi

## üìñ About the Course  
*Literature in Motion* explores how literary works circulate across languages, media, and geographies through processes such as **translation, adaptation, and digital mapping**.  
This course combines theory (translation/adaptation studies, circulation models, world literature) with practice (hands-on digital tools such as Git, GitHub, OpenRefine, Wikidata, and mapping platforms).  

This repository serves as the **central hub** for course activities:  
- Students will **fork** this repo, **clone** their fork locally, and complete weekly exercises.  
- Work will include **notes, datasets, and mapping projects**, organized into shared folder structures.  
- Each week builds toward the final project: an interactive digital map tracing the movement of a literary work across time and space.
