## 🛠️ Step 1 — Fork the instructor repo
1. Go to the instructor repo:  
   👉 [https://github.com/MonirehRazavi/literature-in-motion](https://github.com/MonirehRazavi/literature-in-motion)  
2. Click **Fork** (top-right).  
3. You now have your own copy, for example:  
   👉 `https://github.com/AnneSmith/literature-in-motion`

## 🛠️ Step 2 — Navigate to your class folder
Before cloning, make sure you are inside the folder where you want to keep this project.

```bash
cd ~/Documents/LiteratureInMotion     # go into your course folder
pwd                                   # check where you are
ls                                    # list contents of the folder
